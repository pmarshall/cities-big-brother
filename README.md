cities-big-brother
==================

This was a data collector that worked for Cities (http://cities.totl.net/cgi-bin/game) before my free hosting collapsed. 
It collected a variety of information about the game you were playing, and reported it to a central database. There are
an awful lot of random events in the game (monster drops, growing things from magic beans, upgrading weapons, etc.), so
I wrote Big Brother. In the best programming tradition, I was far too lazy to keep track of things on pen and paper, so
I wrote this instead.
