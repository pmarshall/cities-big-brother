This webpage is little other than a tiny site to host miscellaneous interesting widgets.  At the moment, that means Greasemonkey scripts for the game <a href="http://cities.totl.net/cgi-bin/game">Four Cities</a>. My character name is Cor there, but I post on IRC and the wiki as PotatoEngineer.
<h3>Big Brother</h3>
<p><a href="http://potatoengineer.110mb.com/itemDrop.php">See the Data!</a> </p>
Big Brother will collect data about monster drops, ruins and storeroom searching, treasure chest contents, monster accuracy, mining, farming, foraging, fishing, flying healer stations, milking, weapon breakage (plus some extra data for custom weapon breakage), armor breakage, cornucopia drops, wood-gathering in both jungle and forest, angry bow upgrades, daemonic weapon melting, bowling, the ballroom, whip-snatching, sand-gathering, fairy nuff trades, Harvey Farm digging, poisoning, thief actions, cute seal kudo losses, dragon ninja dodges vs. silver weapons, equipment wearing out while you walk (also equipment that breaks with AP spending, and Iron Blings), nightly spell drops for wizard-types, mines collapsing, wormholes and summon stones breaking, success rates for player thefts, and what monsters eat adventurers the most. (Sadly, the average number of partidges per pear tree has not yet been implemented, and probably never will be.) This webpage is not kept abreast of the latest updates to BB, so please check the Cities Wiki (or better yet, the script itself) for the latest updates.<p></p>

Palantir Cor, or leave a message with PotatoEngineer on the wiki (or IRC), to get your key; you can't submit data without it! As always, feedback appreciated, whether it's bug reports, kudos, comments, suggestions, death threats, or letter bombs. PotatoEngineer 19:07, 10 March 2007 (GMT)

<h3>Outfitter</h3>
This script is the dream of anyone who wears armor or fashion: it can strip you naked, and it can make you wear any number of items, in sequence.  It's also slightly easier on the servers, as it takes roughly half as many clicks as a normal cities player would take, even if it performs them a bit faster than an alert human.
<p>The usage should be fairly clear: click &quot;get naked!&quot; to, er, get naked.  Click &quot;get dressed&quot; to get dressed with exactly the currently selected outfit; the Outfitter will remove any items not from the outfit you've selected.&nbsp;  The configuration screen should be self-explanatory, but you will need to click &quot;apply changes&quot; or change the selected outfit in order to set your changes to any outfits.  I recommend you configure your outfits while naked, so all possible items will show. </p>

<h3>Don't Click It</h3>
This one is written by dragon.&nbsp; It removes all of the &quot;melt&quot; &quot;destroy&quot;, &quot;break&quot;, and other such destructive commands from aligned stones, knives, swords, bows, and katanas, as well as all blings.&nbsp; Version 2.2 here is configurable, and also eliminates the &quot;convert to gold&quot; commands from any Alchemist store you walk into.

<h3>Button Masher</h3>
<strong>Update: Version 1.1</strong> Now it can stop! There's a half-second delay on actions, and a button has been added to the top of the screen that you can click to stop the script. Also, it stops automatically under the following circumstances: you're mining (and the mine you're on just collapsed), you're purchasing (and your hat just got stolen), you're walking (and your boots/tank just wore out), you're fighting (and your last weapon of that type just broke), or you're fighting (and your HP falls below a threshold set in the Button Masher box).<p></p>

This is the industrial-sized version of Stevie-O's BulkBuy script (wherever it's gotten to). It'll create another controls box on the left side of the screen, below the "say" box. Enter the number of repetitions into the textbox, and click any button, and the Button Masher will cheerfully click that many times. Works just fine for shopping, fighting, moving, crafting, foraging, farming, and the like.<p></p>

If you enter a number, and then change your mind, there are two ways to cancel: either delete the number, or refresh the page without clicking any buttons. If the button you're clicking has ceased to exist (for instance, you're attacking a creature, and you killed it, so the act_fight_ button turns into an act_move_ button), the script will stop.

<h3>Chemical Info Mover</h3>
The quest reward for the Blue Flowers quest is at the very bottom of the screen, below even the AP counter, and on low-resolution screens, it's off the bottom of the viewing area. This script moves the information about the chemicals in your bloodstream up into the Abilities box, or right after your inventory if you don't have any Abilities.<p></p>

<h3>Light Wand Damage</h3>
A tiny, tiny scriptlet that displays the damage a light wand does next to your inventory drop-down.  Good for determining whether you're better off using your Furious Bow or Light Wand in the mines.

<h3>Quickdraw (now much quicker!)</h3>
I confess, this script is not mine.  But the standard version takes a half-second to load, on EVERY page load, while pegging the CPU, and is thus a right pain to use on a regular basis.  I've modified the script by making it a little less user-friendly (it doesn't remove any items you're no longer carrying, for example), but on the plus side, it loads <em>much, much faster</em>.  As in "load time is one jiffy or less" faster.  (Useless fact: a jiffy is 1/60th of a second!)<p></p>

As a side note, I've also added "aligned instrument" as a possible button.  It'll select the (basic) instrument for your alignment.
